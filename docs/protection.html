    <h2>A VPN Shield: Ways to Protect Your Data</h2>
    <img src="images/locks.jpg" align="left" style="width: 320px; height: 213px; padding: 10px">
    <p>More security = less convenience
        Why? Privacy is constantly being invaded by google, facebook, the government or other sites that you visit.
        It’s important that your information doesn’t end up in the wrong hands.
    </p><br>
    <h3>Protection Level 1</h3>
    <p>Maintain a password manager that can keep multiple accounts and their passwords in the same place, but with super secure passwords so that
        none of the hidden passwords get stolen. <br> <br>Online security questions should not be answered truthfully either, keep a different password for those questions.
        Two-factor authentication is also important as it allows a double block in trying to access your account. Any web browser is suitable as long as
        applications downloaded on them are safe and secure as well.<br>
        VPNs are helpful in protecting your information on the internet as it blocks it from internet service providers and anyone else that wants to track you.
        It can encrypt any sites that you visit.<br>
        Its preferable that social media doesn’t include your real personal information, that you don’t communicate with strangers, don’t post in public comments
        and disable any permissions possible from that social media site that they don’t need.

    </p><br>

    <img src="images/vpncpu.jpg" align="left" style="width: 320px; height:213px; padding: 10px">
    <h3>Protection Level 2</h3>
    <p>The best applications to use to message is iMessage or another trustworthy app that helps you encrypt your messages.
        Sites such as signal protects both your messages and phone numbers.
        Change emails to a more secure email site to protect your email messages.
        Online storage should be encrypted all the time.
        Passwords should be text only, passwords that involve facial recognition and fingerprints are also unsafe.
    </p><br>
    <h3>The Gist</h3>
    <p>
        Sadly, it is near impossible to be completely safe from the internet and it's data collecting tactics. If you really
        want to be completely hidden on the internet, there are many things you would have to let go of to use it, which brings us
        back to the point that more security = less convenience. Complete protection includes letting go of all and any social media
        that you have, which would then mean no more memes. You are essentially forced to become a minimalist, with a flip phone with limited
        features being the safest phone option for you. <br>
        However, you don't have to go so drastic. You can mitigate the risk in other ways and still be able to share funny pictures with
        your friends. As long as you are navigating to safe trusted websites and making sure that you are not allowing them to have any
        data that they don't need.
